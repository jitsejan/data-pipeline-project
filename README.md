# Data pipeline project
This project aims to work on different aspects of a data pipeline. It is meant to learn new technologies, but hopefully it also helps other people to get inspired. Note that this repository will (slowly) change and get more functionality.

## Objectives
The fictive story I will base this repository on is Mario, since I like to use a theme to work on my project. I will gather some character data and create events to fake the characters moving through different Mario worlds. To do this I will use Python (code), Kafka (Spark streaming) and minIO (object storage). All other tools will follow during the implementation of this project.

- **Data crawler** to get character data
- **Data connection** with minIO storage
- **Event generator** to create the (fake) events
- **Kafka producer** to put events on the Kafka bus
- **Spark Stream reader** to ingest the events
- **Spark Stream parser** to combine ingested data with the character data
- **Dashboard** to visualize the events

## Setting up virtual environment

I use `pipenv` with Python version 3.7.3 to setup the environment.

```bash
$ pipenv --python=3.7

## Installing libraries
Note that `pipenv install` should be used rather than `pip` or `pip3` install when using `pipenv`.

```bash
$ pipenv install lxml

## Testing code
The following will run the tests and the coverage check simultaneously. 

```bash
$ pytest --cov=. -v 
```

Convert the results to HTML for better visiblity on the coverage results.

```bash
$ coverage html
$ open htmlcov/index.hml
```
